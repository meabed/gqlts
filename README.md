Read the [quick start guide](https://gqlts.vercel.app/docs) to generate a client locally

## **Features**

- Type completion
- Type validation
- Easily fetch all fields in a type
- Support subscription ( ws, graphql-ws, observable, etc )
- Built in file upload support
- Graphql Client built in
- Works with any client
- Works in node and the browser
- Built in Axios Client, and exported to extend with interceptors.
- Client Operation support for Axios configuration, such as headers, timeout, cancelToken, abortSignal, etc.
- Support batching queries
- Consistent response format { data, errors, extensions }

> Find more server-client examples in the [examples repo](https://github.com/meabed/graphql-examples)
> You will find multiple examples with different tools of building schema, query, mutation, websocket subscriptions and more.

## Example usage

First generate your client executing

```sh
npm i -D @gqlts/cli # cli to generate the client code
npm i @gqlts/runtime graphql # runtime dependencies
gqlts --schema ./schema.graphql --output ./generated
```

Then you can use your client as follows

```js
import { createClient, everything } from './generated'
const client = createClient()

client
    .query({
        countries: {
            name: true,
            code: true,
            nestedField: {
                ...everything, // same as __scalar: true
            },
        },
    })
    .then(console.log)
```

The code above will fetch the graphql query below

```graphql
query {
  countries {
    name
    code
    nestedField {
      scalarField1
      scalarField2
    }
  }
}
```
